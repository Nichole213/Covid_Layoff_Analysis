# Covid_Layoff_Analysis
I conducted a comprehensive data cleaning, analysis and visualization project on a worldwide workforce layoffs dataset from Covid-19 onset to 2023.

I utilized MySQL for efficient querying and transformation of large datasets; standardized data formats by removing redundant entries and merging duplicated information, resulting in improved data readiness for subsequent analysis.

With the cleaned data, I performed data analysis, using MySQL, to investigate the impact of Covid-19 on layoffs by geography, time, companies, and so on.

After I retrive the data to identify the possible trends of Covid layoffs by measurement, I visualized my finding with Power BI.

The Power BI report shows the possible impact of covid on worldwide labour layoffs from covid onset to 2023. The trends across geography, time, and different companies are highlighted above. Specifically in the "Total Layoff and Its Rolling Sum" diagram, the columns indicate the total layoff while the trend line shows the layoff rolling total.

The analysis shows that the layoffs surged in early 2020, then again in late 2022 and early 2023, with a peak of 84,714 in January 2023. The cumulative total surpassed 380,000 by March 2023. The United States experienced the most layoffs (256,559), followed by India (35,993). While tech companies were major contributors: Uber (2020), Bytedance (2021), Meta & Amazon (2022), and Google & Microsoft (2023) consistently topped the layoff lists.
